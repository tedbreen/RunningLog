I was pretty gassed after that and I was not optimistic about my chances for the rest of the way.  The rest of the leg was not too difficult.  I just felt like shit.  It is hard to pinpoint the main source, but I suspect the altitude played a significant role.  The entire leg was above 6000ft.  I have never run this long and hard at that altitude.  The last couple of miles were really tough.  I was desperately hoping to see the exchange every time i rounded a corner.  By the time I did, I was so done.  Jonah encouraged me to finish strong.  I gave it a nice effort.  Big surprise at the end was Tyler not being ready.  He was still tying his shoes when I finished.  That resulted in a 10-20 second delay or so.  Ah well.')

Ran with Espinosa for the first half. Split it just like I planned (1:22:12) and kept chugging along, but things started going south around 17. That was right before the Newton hills, including Heartbreak. The hills werent that bad, and I wasnt struggling during those hilly miles, but I knew it was only a matter of time before the suffering would start.  Sure enough, started getting cramps at 20. That sucked. They would happen sporadically, without warning, and they persisted for about 5 miles. I was completely at their mercy! Thats when my plan changed from hitting my goal time to finishing without slowing down too much. Lots of talking to myself to keep motivated. Fortunately, the crowds were amazing. Never experienced anything like that. It really helped to see these people going nuts. A lot of old friends were in the crowd and they were able to lift my spirits.  Despite the crowd support, I didnt feel like I was out of the woods until I passed under Mass Ave and I saw Hereford St. What a sweet sight. I rounded the turns, emerged onto Boylston, and soaked in the crowds all the way to the finish.  Additional notes:  in the 16 weeks leading up to Boston, I averaged 57.7 miles per week.  Not bad, but I probably need to average closer to 70 miles.  That wont be hard to do, but injuries in January set me back this time.  Kept the training conservative for the most part.  Already looking forward to Boston 2015.')

Ceded my spot to an SF State runner around the midpoint and ran behind the two of them for the rest of the race. Solid outing this afternoon.  Really had no idea what I was capable of in the 5000m.  Seeded myself at 15:50, which was 12th in the slow heat.  Honestly would have been content with anything under 16 minutes, because all of my training has been geared toward the marathon.  The idea of running sub-5 minute pace was difficult to conceive, but turns out it isnt really that hard.  I tucked right behind Malcolm as soon as the gun went off and felt perfectly comfortable running 74s.  Started to feel uncomfortable at the midway point, which is why I let the SF State guy take my place.  My mental fortitude was starting to unravel around 3200m, but I knew I could grind it out the rest of the way.  I attempted to pick up the pace in order to take back first place (Malcolm pulled out at 4800m), but the SF State guy had just as much left in the tank as I did and he easily held me off.  Oh well.

On the other hand, the downhill was actually pretty cool, and I worked it pretty well for the first four laps.  The uphill on the fourth lap really hurt me though.  It really shredded my quads, and I was starting to have trouble with my turnover.  I had nothing on the enusing (and final) downhill.  I was working so hard just to hang on.  Guys were passing me during this lap.  Fortunately the numbers werent too large as everybody was tired at this point.  After the final climb, which was terrible, the race ended with a nice straight downhill to the chute.  I opened up the legs and went as hard as I could.  Was able to take back some spots and hold any challengers off. Overall, Im not happy about being in the bottom half of the field, but I am satisfied with my effort and performance.  I believe I ran as well as I could have on this day.  Weather conditions were perfect.  Footing was fine.  The only thing holding me back was fitness that was inferior to most of the field.

When the gun went off, a guy in an Aggies singlet (Kota Reichert) took off and I went with him.  I wasnt sure if he was truly fast or just exuberant.  I finally decided after two miles of fast running that it was the former.  I wasnt prepared to hold on at that pace, so I basically shut it down and settled into a manageable pace.  I was never in too much pain, but those first couple miles put me in debt for sure.  Perhaps the smart thing would have been to stick with my original plan of running 5:20-5:30 pace from beginning to end.  Damn competitive instincts!  Anyway, I liked the course.

Warmed up a total of 5 miles up to Childs Park and started the tempo up there at Coolie Dick down Rt 9 back to Smith. Obviously it was majority downhill but I was moving too.

Bric was talking about doing threshold pace but I just went with it. 73, 2:26, 3:02 for the first one and I kept trying to hold back. Felt so nice and smooth but it set the tone of the workout as not threshold. I was on a faster pace the next two but backed off the last 200 to not drop the pace too much too quick. Then after the 3rd Bric suggested a longer rest and then maybe drop down to strides or 200s and I was looking forward to the longer rest but the wind picked up and Bric launched us into my last k off 200 rest again. Negative split this one 37, 73, 2:24, 2:58 (34 last 200). Was pretty wiped but Bric wanted to do another one.
